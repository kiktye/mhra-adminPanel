## üöÄ About

The **Macedonian Human Resource Association (MHRA) Admin Panel** is designed to manage the content that will be displayed on the MHRA website. This admin panel provides the admin with the ability to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) resources that will reflect on the public website.

## Resources

-   View all users registered in the system.
-   Restrict users if they've violated terms (optional).

-   Add hours, points, and subpoints for each agenda section, all dynamically.

### Speaker

-   Add new speakers by entering their information.
-   Specify whether the speaker is a special guest (for conferences only).
-   Save speakers to events or conferences as needed.

# Agenda Management

Both **events** and **conferences** include an **agenda** timeline, and the admin panel provides a dedicated tool for managing the agenda. The admin can create agendas for one or multiple days and link them to events or conferences.

## Features

### Full Control for Admins:

-   CRUD functionality for Users, Employees, Blogs, Events, Conferences, Speakers.
-   Can manage the home page.
-   Ability to plan and manage agendas for both events and conferences.

### Scalable Database:

-   The database schema is designed for flexibility, allowing for easy future changes like adding new tables or updating existing ones.

### User Interface:

-   The admin panel has a custom UI, designed by me which I find to be user-friendly for the admins. Admins have full control over the resources, and the interface makes it easy to navigate and manage content.

## üìù How to Set Up

To set up the admin panel, follow these steps:

```shell
# Open a terminal

# Ensure Git is installed
# Visit https://git-scm.com to download and install console Git if not already installed

# Clone the repository
git clone https://git.brainster.co/Kiko.Stojanov-FS15/bp-kikostojanovfs15.git
git checkout project03

# Install dependencies
composer install
npm install

# Set up the environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Generate application key:
php artisan key:generate

# Configure your database in the .env file
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=mhra_admin
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=

# Run migrations to set up the database
php artisan migrate

# Seed the database for dummy data
php artisan db:seed

# Link storage
php artisan storage:link

# Run the local server
php artisan serve
npm run dev


```

## üìö Documentation

After seeding the database, you can log in as an administrator using the following credentials:

```shell
Email: admin@mhra.com
Password: secret
```

As an admin, you can manage users, including restricting access for those who have violated terms. You can view the blogs written by each user, along with all comments and likes. You can also access their friend list and see the recommendations they've given and received from other users. Additionally, you can manage employee information, such as editing, deleting, or adding new employees with details like name, photo, title, and social links. You can assign a position to each employee, and if the position doesn‚Äôt exist, you can create a new role directly from the panel.

In the Blogs section, you can view detailed information about each blog, including the author, comments, and likes. You can moderate comments by removing inappropriate ones or restoring them if needed. Blogs can be featured with a single click, and you'll have the ability to edit the title, description, images, and individual sections. You can also view related blogs.

For events, you can manage the event details, including time, location, and speaker information. You can remove speakers if necessary and adjust ticket pricing. Like blogs, events can also be featured on the frontend. You can edit the event‚Äôs agenda by adding sections, subtitles, or even new days. Related events are also shown.

For the Annual Conference, there are three statuses: active, inactive, or canceled. You can manage details such as the conference date, location, speakers, special guests, and ticket packages. You can also edit the agenda, title, and description, and change the conference status as needed.

The Agenda Tool allows you to build a unique agenda, dynamically adding days, hours, points, and subpoints. Finally, you can add new speakers to events or conferences, and if they‚Äôre special guests, they can be tied specifically to a conference.

## User Manual

I think the UI/UX is pretty self explanatory, although there is some stuff I need to address.
In order to create Event or Conference, the Agenda needs to be created first. Then on the Page for creating Event/Conference there is the option to choose the specific agenda you want to use, which you can recognize by the unique name you can give your Agenda.
If you're creating Agenda for an Event, which is single day, I suggest typing the actual date ( ex. 25 July 2024 ), if you're creating an agenda for a conference which can be multi day, I would suggest to be Day 1, Day 2...
The speakers are added after the Event or Conference is created and written into the system.
If you choose the speaker to be a special guest, you can only save it for a Conference.
